  title: Click to Dial Service API
  description: |
    The Click to Dial API allows users to initiate and manage calls via an enterprise platform or application. The API processes call requests, sets up the call, and provides optional notifications and call recording features. For specific details, please refer to [click-to-dial_API.md](/documentation/API_documentation/click-to-dial_API.md)。

    # Introduction

    The API displays the enterprise business number to both users during a call, masking both the caller and callee’s real numbers to preserve privacy. Real-time feedback and notifications are supported via HTTP callbacks. Enterprise members share a pool of minutes, with the enterprise bearing unified payment, eliminating issues such as exceeding limits or wasting leftover package resources, thus reducing costs and increasing efficiency for the enterprise.

    # API functionality

    - Begin Operation: Establish a call between the caller and the callee. Include a callback URL for status notifications in the format of a valid HTTP/HTTPS URI, e.g., "https://example.com/callback".
    - Recording Download Operation: Download the recording of the call.
    - Release Operation: End the call between the caller and the callee.
  
    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/).

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

                Important: this endpoint is to be implemented by the API consumer.
                The API provider reports the call status between the caller and the callee to the API consumer through this endpoint.
                The API provider will call this endpoint whenever any call status change related event occurs, currently only `CALL_STATUS_CHANGED` event is defined.
